"If it's bad it isn't sex."

Water rushing over boulders.

Regarding toasts: "If you don't make eye contact you will have bad sex for seven years, we French say."

Are French ex-pats more Platonist than French nationals?

She speaks always of what is done in France to eager American ears. Having lived here for a decade, she has become what Americans imagine. First she worked at a vineyard, and now she makes cheese. Someone reaches across the table to ask her to choose what cheeses to order. Politically, she says, "it's worse there," and her audience visibly recedes. We look down into our wine glasses. French.

We discuss a boy who has raw aptitude. "We"--the one with the strict definition of sex and her daughter--"think he's a super-taster." The daughter has a liberal arts education and is not eager to quash his fourteen-year-old perspective. He has become legendary in their half-professional foodie mileu by making the disparate comparison between a Bourdeaux and the milk at the end of a bowl of fruit loops. Suddenly seeing how cramped their world is, wine people want to buy his electricity. They want to groom the surprising insights won from a life of eating at McDonalds into the voice of their profession.

The daughter has shifted the emphasis of her mother's *no bad sex* to *no weak emotion*. *Lemonade* is her ideal album because listening to it, she feels rage, which, while negative, is felt toward someone else.

Her friend says: "Women are good at doing what they need to do. Some people just feel sad. They haven't had to deal with necessities, had to put food on their kids' table." It sounds odd, but perhaps one can be good at what is necessary. Competence, I tell myself, must be a form of sadness. There is no barrier if I think my experience is all. Worldview unshaken, I take another gulp of wine. Perhaps I can't read Marguerite Duras' "perhaps" where she writes: "Perhaps women secrete their own despair in the process of becoming mothers and wives. Perhaps, their whole lives long, they lose their rightful kingdom in the despair of every day."

The prodigy is said to "have no experiences"--no tasting experiences. At the same time, his experiences (of a life of taste-poverty) are what the daughter and I are worrying about preserving, and what her mother and the rest are salivating to assimilate.

Walking downstream, looking for eddies.

He winks. He winks a lot. His eye contact is interrupted by these assurances that are not very reassuring. What he doesn't undertand about the Tour de France, where he draws the line between his experience and the thing in question, is that after riding for an hour his balls hurt. For him the thing jamms on the body. "I don't know, maybe it's the same for you," he gestures to the women at the table, and perhaps winks.

I feel cool for my accidental contrarianism: On the day everyone was talking about how addicted to Pokemon Go they were, I was wandering around town taking pictures with my phone. They, I boast, were looking for confirmation of things found, whereas I, heartbroken, was looking for scenes that would reflect loss back to me. Now that my extravagant self-indulgence (feeling sad) has passed, it seems possible that I didn't say goodbye so that I might regret it, to have something to grip.

Water faster than I'm walking.

Alcohol affords one many regrets, and at the same time deadens them. "I would say the opposite," I said about *if it's bad it isn't sex*, "how else would there be anything to look forward to?"

Back in 2002 or so, a popular way to dismiss electronic music was to call it repetitive. More recently, my friend deftly cut me down to size: "You could say you have a strong personal sense of narrative." Life, like the memorable part of a song, seems to be made up of a small collection of repeated phrases. I think that narrative is distinct from singing along--singing those memorable scraps of a song over and over--and yet my story is caught in grooves.

*Go Princess Go* is about a man who speaks the language of pick up artist finding himself in the body of a princess 1,000 years ago. Her/his interactions with men are inflected with that particular strain of cynicism. "This is a rhythm to get girls," he tells us across the fourth wall. Some things are clearer in translation than native speakers make them.

Such axioms sound good until I, who speak Spanish poorly and English with as much fluency as can be expected from daily necessity, converse with someone whose English is as good as my Spanish, and whose Spanish is as good as my English. Both of us are so concerned with orthodoxy that neither's phrasing can be original, and anyway originality must be gotten by naively. In bouts of espirit de escalier in which I struggle to remember the correct word in Spanish, all the coinings I think are clever would very likely simply sound muddled. Ry ly ly.

The repeating phrases I live in always sound true, no matter how many moments of clarity I have about their fraudulency. "Why would you hang on to something like that?" I remember one asking the other on their way in the door. They were talking about what I was feeling at that moment. Their conversation may be the banter of friends who bonded over a common school of Buddhism (and thus a shared language), but no matter how much I deride it, they are still talking about me. The only explanation is that they overheard me at the sink moaning the name of someone I was not letting go of. Memory is so holey that because I can't remember if one of them was in the bathroom on the other side of the wall from me when I moaned, one of them *was* there.

It's easier to reflect when remorseful than when jealous, but is the brain on remorse a pile of poo? In other words, I am deceived that something is more valuable when it is more scarce.

We drove through a logging town where the economic depression creates a soothing atmosphere for those unaffected by it. A garbage truck stopped to let us by a narrow part of the road, and as we drove by he said "don't speed up on my account! I've only got work to do!"

Is timing the only difference between melodrama and wtf? Every story in retrospect seems like a crutch. The story I was telling myself changed so much so quickly to meet the facts as they became apparent that I began resorting to postmodernist cliches. Stories are meaningless constructions that are nonetheless necessarily rule us, etc. But isn't the hallmark of a good soap opera the twist? Must it merely be deployed with a good sense of pace to be part of a juicy plot instead of an effacement of plot?
